  <h1>How to play Eressea</h1>

  <h2><a name="register" id="register">Getting started</a></h2>

  <p>In the past, each week new players were added in new regions to the
  expanding game world. This is no longer the case. All currently running
  games are closed and do not accept new players. You can however sing up
  on a waiting list at <a href="http://www.eressea.de/en/register.php">www.eressea.de/en/register.php</a>.
  If enough players have shown interest, a new game might happen.</p>

  <h2><a name="requirements" id="requirements">System requirements</a></h2>

  <p>Eressea requires very little to play. Apart from an email account, the
  only thing you need is a computer and a text editor. This can be notepad
  for Windows, or even vi or emacs for Linux. You could even type the orders
  directly into your mail tool if you like. Make sure you use a plain text
  editor, not a word processor like Staroffice or Word; the game cannot read
  anything but plain text.</p>

  <p>Most likely, though, you will want something more visual. There are some
  wonderful graphical clients available to play Eressea with, like Magellan
  or EMap, as well as secondary tools for statistics, order preprocessing or
  mapmaking. All of these can be found via the game's web page and best of
  all, they are all free, written by players for players.</p>

  <h2><a name="sending" id="sending">Sending in your orders</a></h2>

  <p>Once you've written your orders, you must send them to the game server.
  They must be sent to <a href="mailto:eressea-server@eressea.kn-bremen.de">eressea-server@eressea.kn-bremen.de</a>
  with the subject ERESSEA X ORDERS in order to be recognized and processed, 
  where you have substitute X with the number of your game. So for Eressea 2
  the subject would be ERESSEA 2 ORDERS. If you have already sent in orders,
  and find that you want to make changes, send in a second set of orders; they
  will override the old ones. A lot of players send in preliminary orders
  early in the week, and another set later in the week, when diplomacy with
  other players has made changes necessary.
  Make sure your computer's clock is set correctly. The game server uses the
  time at which you send the orders to determine the latest orders, not the
  time of their arrival.</p>

  <p>Remember: Your turn has to be sent as plain text. Today, many mailers
  offer rich text or even HTML formatted text. These are not readable by the
  game server. If you want to send your orders as an attachment, they have to
  be encoded as text/plain MIME attachments. If you don't know what that is,
  or if you don't want to take chances, paste the orders into the body of
  your e-mail instead. Due to the increasing number of different formats,
  mail tools, and buggy implementations that exist today, the number of
  players who get this wrong increases steadily.</p>

  <p>When your orders reach the game server, they are processed by a simple
  form of our syntax checker, ECheck. The results of this check will be sent
  to you, and you should read them carefully. While an English version of
  ECheck exists, it is not perfect, and inconsistencies between it and the
  server may occur. Orders which ECheck considers legitimate may be ignore by
  the server, and vice versa. This is an example of sample output you will
  receive in the mail from ECheck:</p>
  <pre>
  ECHECK (Version 3.4.2, Jun 12 2000), Zug-Checker für Eressea - Freeware!

  Verarbeite Datei `faroul@beyond.kn-bremen.de,2'.

  Es wurden Befehle für 1 Partei und 100 Einheiten gelesen.
  Die Befehle scheinen in Ordnung zu sein.
</pre>

  <p>The last two lines of the output are the important ones. In this case,
  they translate to: "There were orders for 1 faction and 100 units sent in.
  The orders seem to be okay". If it says 0 factions, or even 0 units, your
  mail may not be in a proper format. <b>Remember, the English ECheck is not
  perfect, and may not match what the server will accept</b>. To make sure
  your orders are valid, ask someone for help; the Eressea help list <a href=
  "mailto:eressea-help@eressea.kn-bremen.de">eressea-help@eressea.kn-bremen.de</a>
  is a good place to start.</p>

  <p>The game server parses incoming orders immediately. If you do
  not get a reply to your orders within 20 minutes, there is something wrong,
  and you should consider sending them again. Try sending them from an
  alternative mail account if you have one.</p>

  <p>If you fail to send in orders for three consecutive weeks, you will be
  removed from the game.</p>

  <h2><a name="notes" id="notes">Things to remember</a></h2>

  <p>The first line of your orders must begin with ERESSEA &lt;faction
  no.&gt; &lt;password&gt;, where you replace &lt;faction no.&gt; with the id
  of your faction, and &lt;password&gt; with your password. A line containing
  the word NEXT should be at the very end of your order file, telling the
  server that your orders are finished completely, and that it should ignore
  everything else in your email.</p>

  <p>You can write one order per line. If your mail program breaks long
  lines, then you have to add a continuation character at the end of the
  line. Simply add a \ at the end to tell the game server to continue
  processing in the next line, like this:</p>
  <pre>
DESCRIBE UNIT "The heroes of the second war on Andune have enjoyed \
       their retirement for long. Now their country depends upon \
       them once again, and they march against the Dark Alliance."
